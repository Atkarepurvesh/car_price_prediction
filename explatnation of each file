🔹 app.py (two copies)
Purpose: Flask app file — likely the main entry point of your web application.

One of these files should be deleted or renamed to avoid confusion.

It typically defines routes like /, processes user input, and renders HTML templates.

🔹 train_model.py
Purpose: Script that trains the machine learning model.

Reads data from car_purchasing.csv.

Trains a regression or forecasting model.

Saves the trained model as a .pkl file in the model/ folder.

🔹 requirements.txt
Purpose: Lists Python libraries needed to run your app.

Typical entries: Flask, pandas, scikit-learn, joblib, etc.

Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install dependencies.

🔹 .gitignore
Purpose: Tells Git which files/folders to ignore (e.g., temporary files, model files, logs).

Common entries: __pycache__/, .pkl, .env, etc.

🔹 car_purchasing.csv (also found in data/)
Purpose: Dataset containing car purchase records.

Used for training or testing ML models.

Duplicate should be removed for clarity.

🔹 car_price_model.pkl
Purpose: Saved machine learning model for car price prediction.

Loaded in app.py for inference.

📁 Folder Explanations
